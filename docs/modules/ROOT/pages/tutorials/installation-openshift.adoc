# Install vcluster on OpenShift

This page guides through the installation process of vcluster on OpenShift and sets up authentication with OIDC using Keycloak.

At the end of this tutorial we will have:

* a vcluster instance running on OpenShift
* vcluster's Kubernetes API exposed with an Ingress
* Let's Encrypt certificates provisioned by `cert-manager`
* OIDC authentication

== Prerequisites

* Understanding how to configure and compile cluster catalogs
* Admin access to existing Keycloak instances
* `kubectl`
* `base64`
* `jq`

== Deploy vcluster and Ingress

. Configure catalog
+
[source,yaml]
----
parameters:
  vcluster:
    k3s:
      additional_args:
        - --kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-issuer-url=https://keycloak.example.com/auth/realms/realm <1>
        - --kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-client-id=client-id <2>
        - --kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-username-claim=preferred_username
        - --kube-apiserver-arg=oidc-groups-claim=groups
    ingress:
      host: vcluster.example.com
      annotations:
        route.openshift.io/termination: reencrypt <3>
----
<1> The Keycloak URL and realm
<2> The client ID in Keycloak
<3> Needed to communicate with the encrypted vcluster endpoint

. Compile and push cluster catalog
+
[NOTE]
====
This will create 2 OpenShift Route objects; one for the Ingress and one for the Let's Encrypt HTTP01 verification.
====

. Create DNS record for custom Ingress host and point to the cluster's Router.

. Wait until Let's Encrypt has provisioned a valid certificate and only 1 Route exists for the same Ingress.
+
[TIP]
====
You can inspect the certificate provisioning with `kubecl get certificate,order`.
====

== Configure Keycloak

. Add Role to client
+
In the client settings, select the "Roles" tab.
Click "Add Role" button and enter the role name "Admin" with a description and hit save.

. Configure Mapper to include Roles in `groups` token
+
In the client settings, select the "Mappers" tab.
Click "Create" button and configure the following settings before saving:
+
[source,console]
----
Name = groups
Mapper Type = User Client Role
Client ID = <the-client-id>
Token Claim Name = "groups"
Claim JSON Type = String
